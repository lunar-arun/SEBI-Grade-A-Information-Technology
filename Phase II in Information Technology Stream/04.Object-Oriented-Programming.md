**Topics: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance**

These notes include definitions, examples, diagrams (text), advantages, and financial-sector applications.

# 🌟 What is Object-Oriented Programming?

OOP is a programming paradigm based on **objects** that contain both **data (attributes)** and **behavior (methods)**.
It models real-world entities and improves modularity, security, scalability, and maintenance.

Four major OOP principles:
✔ **Abstraction**
✔ **Encapsulation**
✔ **Polymorphism**
✔ **Inheritance**

---

# 1️⃣ **ABSTRACTION**

## ✔ Definition

Abstraction means **showing only essential features** of an object while hiding unnecessary details.

> *Focus on what an object does, not how it does it.*

Example:

* When you type `print()` in Python, you do not know internal buffer handling.
* ATM: You interact with buttons, not internal circuitry.

## ✔ In Programming

Achieved via:

* **Abstract classes**
* **Interfaces**
* **Abstract methods**
* **Function declarations without implementation**

### Example (Java-like)

```java
abstract class TradeOrder {
    abstract void validate();
}
```

## ✔ Benefits

* Reduces complexity
* Enhances code readability
* Allows implementation hiding
* Helps build scalable systems

## ✔ Real-World / SEBI / Finance Use

* Market data APIs expose abstract interfaces
* Trading systems use abstract “Order”/“Trade” classes
* Risk modules expose abstract methods for calculations

---

# 2️⃣ **ENCAPSULATION**

## ✔ Definition

Encapsulation is **binding data and methods together**, and **restricting direct access** to some components.

> *It protects data integrity.*

## ✔ How it is done

* Private variables
* Public methods (“getters” and “setters”)
* Access modifiers (private, public, protected)

### Example

```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance;

    public void deposit(double amt) { balance += amt; }
    public double getBalance() { return balance; }
}
```

Here:

* `balance` is protected from unauthorized modification.
* Only methods can modify it.

## ✔ Benefits

* Data protection
* Prevents unintended access
* Controlled data modification
* Improves maintainability

## ✔ Financial Use Cases

* Ensuring account balances cannot be modified directly
* Sensitive data like PAN, Aadhaar, transactions stored privately
* Secure modules in trading platforms

# 3️⃣ **POLYMORPHISM**

## ✔ Definition

Polymorphism means **same function name, different behaviors**, depending on context.

Two major types:

---

## ⭐ A. **Compile-time Polymorphism**

(Static Binding / Method Overloading)

### Example

```java
class Order {
    void place() {}
    void place(String type) {}
}
```

* Same method name
* Different parameters
* Selected at compile time

---

## ⭐ B. **Run-time Polymorphism**

(Dynamic Binding / Method Overriding)

### Example

```java
class Order {
    void execute() { System.out.println("General order"); }
}

class MarketOrder extends Order {
    void execute() { System.out.println("Market order execute"); }
}
```

Here final method selected at **runtime**.

## ✔ Benefits of Polymorphism

* Flexible code
* Extensibility
* Reusability
* Cleaner interfaces

## ✔ Financial Use Examples

* Different order types (market, limit, stop-loss) override a common `execute()` method
* Different risk models override `calculateRisk()`
* Multiple reporting formats implement `generateReport()`

---

# 4️⃣ **INHERITANCE**

## ✔ Definition

Inheritance allows a class (**child/derived class**) to **acquire properties** of another class (**parent/base class**).

> *Code reusability + hierarchical classification.*

---

## Types of Inheritance

1. **Single inheritance** → One parent, one child
2. **Multilevel inheritance** → Parent → Child → Grandchild
3. **Hierarchical inheritance** → One parent, multiple children
4. **Multiple inheritance** (supported in C++, not in Java for classes; interfaces allow it)

---

### Example

```java
class Order { 
    double price;
}

class LimitOrder extends Order {
    double limitPrice;
}
```

## ✔ Benefits

* Reusability
* Logical organization
* Reduced code redundancy

## ✔ Disadvantages

* Overuse leads to tightly coupled hierarchy
* Diamond problem (resolved by interfaces/virtual inheritance)

# 🌳 MINI DIAGRAM FOR OOP (Write in Descriptive Answer)

```
           [ Abstraction ]
                 |
                 v
   [ Class ] ----> Provides blueprint
       |
       v
[ Encapsulation ] ----> Protects data
       |
       v
[ Inheritance ] ----> Reuse behavior
       |
       v
[ Polymorphism ] ----> Flexible behavior
```

# 5️⃣ **OOP ADVANTAGES (for SEBI descriptive answers)**

* Models real-world entities
* Enhances security through encapsulation
* Improves modularity
* Promotes code reuse
* Supports scalable system architecture
* Easier maintenance and debugging
* Better suited for large enterprise applications
* Industry-standard approach for trading systems, fintech, risk engines, APIs

# 6️⃣ **APPLICATIONS OF OOP IN FINANCIAL/SEBI SYSTEMS**

* **Trading Platforms**

  * Orders, trades, instruments as objects
  * Polymorphism for different order types

* **Risk Management Systems**

  * Different risk calculators inheriting a base class
  * Modular design of VAR, margin, stress testing modules

* **Market Surveillance Systems**

  * Encapsulation of trader profiles and alerts

* **Databases and ORM tools**

  * Entity classes represent tables

* **APIs and services**

  * Abstract interfaces for market data providers
