# 🔥 **HIGH COMPLEXITY CASELET – 1**

### **Stock Exchange – Real-Time Market Data Pipeline**

The National Market Data Repository (NMDR) stores real-time tick-level data (price, volume, bid/ask) for thousands of securities.
Incoming tick rate = **1 million ticks/sec**.

Key design choices:

* MarketTick(Ticker, Time, Price, Volume, Bid, Ask)
* Index on (Ticker, Time) using **B+ tree**
* Data is partitioned by **date**
* A secondary hash index exists on Ticker
* Queries often fetch **last 1-minute window** for a Ticker
* Batch jobs perform massive range scans overnight

# 🔥 **HIGH COMPLEXITY CASELET – 2**

### **Securities Fraud Detection – Graph & Relational Mix**

SEBI develops a hybrid system to analyze suspicious trading patterns:

**Relational tables**

* Trader(TraderID, PAN, Address)
* Trade(TradeID, TraderID, Time, Price, Volume)
* Security(SecID, Name, Sector)

**Graph database**

* Nodes: Traders
* Edges: “Connected-To” based on:

  * sharing same device IP
  * sharing PAN address
  * trading same security within 1-second window

Graph queries frequently retrieve:

* Clusters of traders trading the same security rapidly
* Path of relationships between suspicious traders

The system blends **relational and graph queries** through a federated engine.
Indexes:

* B+ tree on Trade(Security, Time)
* Bitmap index on Security(Sector)
* Hash index on Trader(PAN)

Problem:
Queries that join relational tables with graph edges become extremely slow.

### **Q1.**

Why might joins between relational engine and graph engine be slow?

a) Bitmap indexes are incompatible with joins
b) High cost of cross-store data movement
c) B+ trees cannot index graph nodes
d) Graph edges cannot be stored in memory

---

### **Q2.**

Which relational index MOST helps identify “rapid group trading” of a security?

a) Bitmap index on Sector
b) Hash index on PAN
c) B+ tree on (Security, Time)
d) No index helps

---

### **Q3.**

If two traders share same PAN address, the system adds a graph edge.
Which integrity constraint ensures PAN cannot be NULL in Trader?

a) Domain constraint
b) Check constraint
c) Entity integrity
d) Referential integrity

---

### **Q4.**

To efficiently find trading groups within a 1-second window, which data structure is best?

a) Heap file
b) Skip lists
c) B+ tree leaf-node range scan
d) Bitmap index on Security

---

### **Q5.**

A heavy query loads all graph nodes connected within 2 hops of a suspicious trader.
Which optimization can help MOST?

a) Pushdown predicates into graph engine
b) Denormalize Trader table
c) Replace graph DB with hash tables
d) Remove bitmap index

---

### **Q6.**

The biggest bottleneck in such hybrid analytics systems typically is:

a) MVCC overhead
b) Disk latency
c) Network shuffling of large intermediate results
d) Normalization anomalies

# 🔥 **HIGH COMPLEXITY CASELET – 3**

### **Corporate Disclosures – Document Search & Metadata DB**

SEBI must scan **millions** of corporate disclosure PDFs.
A metadata relational DB stores:

Document(DocID, CompanyID, Sector, Date, Size, Keywords, Rating)

Indexes:

* Full-text inverted index on Keywords
* B+ tree on (CompanyID, Date)
* Bitmap index on Sector
* Hash index on DocID

Workloads:

* Analysts filter by **sector + date ranges**
* Full-text search on keywords
* Trend queries across companies
* Batch loads nightly add ~200k documents
* Updates are rare, but INSERTS are huge

Issues observed:

* Full-text search is fast
* But “Sector + Date range + Keyword” queries become slow
* Bitmap index sometimes grows excessively large
* Analysts want **real-time** search after documents are uploaded

---

### **Q1.**

Why does the query “Sector + Date range + Keyword” degrade?

a) Bitmap indexes do not combine well with range scans
b) B+ tree prevents full-text queries
c) Hash index conflicts with text index
d) Full-text index is corrupt

---

### **Q2.**

Bitmap index grows very large because:

a) Sector has high cardinality
b) Sector has low cardinality
c) Date column is fragmented
d) Keywords are multivalued

---

### **Q3.**

Nightly batch loads (200k inserts) slow down due to index maintenance.
Which strategy helps BEST?

a) Disable all indexes during bulk load and rebuild
b) Move Sector to separate table
c) Convert bitmap index to hash index
d) Use 3NF decomposition

---

### **Q4.**

For near real-time search indexing, which architecture is MOST suitable?

a) Rebuilding entire inverted index every hour
b) LSM-tree based full-text engine (e.g., Lucene/Solr/Elastic)
c) B+ tree indexing for text
d) Using bitmap indexes for keywords

---

### **Q5.**

Why do bitmap indexes perform well for OLAP but poorly for high insert workloads?

a) Bitmaps require locking during reads
b) Bitmaps expand on every insert and must rebalance
c) Bitmaps don’t store metadata
d) Bitmaps cannot handle NULLs

---

### **Q6.**

Analysts want to see documents immediately after upload.
What is the main technical challenge?

a) Full-text index latency to incorporate new documents
b) Bitmap index corruption
c) CompanyID not normalized
d) Sector dimension too large
