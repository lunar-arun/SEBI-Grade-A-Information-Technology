# 📘 **DATA WAREHOUSING – Complete Notes**

---

## 🔹 1. Introduction to Data Warehousing

### **Definition**

A **Data Warehouse (DW)** is a **centralized repository** that stores **integrated, subject-oriented, time-variant, and non-volatile** data from multiple sources to support **decision-making** and **business intelligence (BI)**.

### **Key Characteristics (as per Bill Inmon)**

1. **Subject-Oriented** – Organized around key subjects like sales, customers, or products.
2. **Integrated** – Data from multiple heterogeneous sources is made consistent.
3. **Time-Variant** – Data is stored with time stamps; supports historical analysis.
4. **Non-Volatile** – Once entered, data is not updated or deleted frequently; only new data is added.

### **Purpose**

* To support strategic decision-making.
* To perform OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) and reporting.
* To analyze trends, patterns, and performance over time.

---

## 🔹 2. Data Warehouse Architecture

### **Three-Tier Architecture**

1. **Bottom Tier:**
   Data sources (operational databases, legacy systems, external data).
2. **Middle Tier:**
   The **Data Warehouse** itself (data staging, ETL – Extraction, Transformation, Loading, and OLAP engine).
3. **Top Tier:**
   **Front-end tools** for analysis, query, reporting, dashboards, and data mining.

### **Components**

* **Data Source Layer**
* **ETL Layer**
* **Data Storage Layer (Data Warehouse)**
* **Metadata Layer**
* **Presentation/Analysis Layer**

## 🔹 3. Data Extraction

### **Definition**

Data extraction is the process of **retrieving data from multiple, possibly heterogeneous, sources** (e.g., databases, files, APIs).

### **Types of Extraction**

1. **Full Extraction:**
   All data is extracted each time.
2. **Incremental Extraction:**
   Only data changed since the last extraction is retrieved (using timestamps, change data capture, etc.).

### **Challenges**

* Heterogeneous data formats.
* Data redundancy.
* Incomplete or inconsistent data.

---

## 🔹 4. Data Cleaning

### **Definition**

Data cleaning (or data scrubbing) involves **detecting and correcting errors or inconsistencies** in data to improve quality.

### **Common Data Quality Issues**

* Missing values
* Duplicate records
* Inconsistent formats (e.g., “NY” vs “New York”)
* Outliers and noise

### **Techniques**

* **Validation rules** (range, format checks)
* **Deduplication**
* **Standardization**
* **Data imputation** for missing values
* **Outlier detection**

### **Goal**

Ensure **accuracy**, **consistency**, and **reliability** of data before loading it into the warehouse.

---

## 🔹 5. Data Transformation

### **Definition**

Data transformation converts extracted data into a **common format or structure** suitable for analysis and storage in the warehouse.

### **Transformation Operations**

* **Data mapping** (source to target fields)
* **Aggregation** (e.g., daily to monthly sales)
* **Normalization / Denormalization**
* **Encoding / Decoding**
* **Data type conversion**
* **Deriving new calculated fields**

### **Example**

Converting date formats (e.g., `DD-MM-YYYY` → `YYYY-MM-DD`)
Combining `First Name` and `Last Name` into `Full Name`

---

## 🔹 6. Data Loading

### **Definition**

Data loading is the process of **moving transformed data into the final target (data warehouse or data mart).**

### **Types**

1. **Initial Load:** Loading data for the first time.
2. **Incremental Load:** Periodic updates (daily, weekly).
3. **Full Refresh:** Completely deleting and reloading the warehouse data.

### **Approaches**

* **Batch Loading:** Data loaded in scheduled batches.
* **Real-Time Loading:** Continuous loading as new data arrives.

### **Tools**

ETL tools like **Informatica**, **Talend**, **Microsoft SSIS**, **Pentaho**, **Apache Nifi**.

---

## 🔹 7. Metadata

### **Definition**

**Metadata** is "data about data" — information describing the structure, operations, and meaning of warehouse data.

### **Types**

1. **Technical Metadata:**

   * Source systems
   * ETL processes
   * Data lineage (origin, transformation)
2. **Business Metadata:**

   * Business definitions
   * Owner, usage, purpose of data
3. **Operational Metadata:**

   * Load times
   * Access frequency
   * Error logs

### **Importance**

* Enables efficient management and retrieval of data.
* Assists in auditing and troubleshooting ETL processes.

---

## 🔹 8. Data Cube

### **Definition**

A **data cube** is a **multidimensional array** of data used to represent data in OLAP systems.

### **Dimensions and Measures**

* **Dimensions:** Perspectives for analysis (e.g., time, geography, product)
* **Measures:** Quantitative data (e.g., sales amount, profit)

### **Operations on Data Cubes (OLAP Operations)**

1. **Roll-up:** Aggregating data (e.g., daily → monthly → yearly)
2. **Drill-down:** Viewing data at a finer granularity
3. **Slice:** Selecting one dimension (e.g., sales in 2025)
4. **Dice:** Selecting sub-cube by specifying ranges of dimensions
5. **Pivot:** Reorienting the cube for better visualization

### **Example**

| Product | Region | Year | Sales |
| ------- | ------ | ---- | ----- |
| A       | North  | 2023 | 1M    |
| A       | South  | 2023 | 0.8M  |

Data cube allows analyzing **sales by product, region, and year** simultaneously.

---

## 🔹 9. Data Mart

### **Definition**

A **Data Mart** is a **subset of a data warehouse**, focused on a specific business area (e.g., marketing, finance, HR).

### **Types**

1. **Dependent Data Mart:** Derived from a central warehouse.
2. **Independent Data Mart:** Created directly from operational systems.
3. **Hybrid Data Mart:** Combines data from both warehouse and other sources.

### **Advantages**

* Faster access to specific data.
* Easier to maintain.
* Tailored for departmental needs.

### **Comparison: Data Warehouse vs Data Mart**

| Feature             | Data Warehouse    | Data Mart                |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Scope               | Organization-wide | Department-level         |
| Data Source         | Multiple sources  | Usually one subject area |
| Size                | Large             | Smaller                  |
| Complexity          | High              | Moderate                 |
| Implementation Time | Longer            | Shorter                  |

## 🔹 10. Data Models in Data Warehousing

### **Definition**

A **data model** defines how data is logically structured and stored in the warehouse.

### **Types of Data Models**

1. **Conceptual Model:** High-level view of data (entities, relationships).
2. **Logical Model:** Describes data in terms of tables, columns, keys.
3. **Physical Model:** Specifies how data is actually stored (indexes, partitions).

### **Data Warehouse Schema Models**

1. **Star Schema**

   * One **fact table** (quantitative data) surrounded by multiple **dimension tables**.
   * Simple and efficient for queries.
   * Example:

     * **Fact Table:** Sales
     * **Dimensions:** Time, Product, Store, Customer

2. **Snowflake Schema**

   * Dimensions are **normalized** into multiple related tables.
   * Reduces redundancy but more complex joins.

3. **Galaxy (Fact Constellation) Schema**

   * Multiple fact tables sharing dimension tables.
   * Used for complex data warehouses.

### **Short Answer Hints**

1. **Data Warehousing:** Central repository integrating data from multiple sources for analysis and decision-making.
2. **OLTP vs OLAP:**

   * OLTP → Operational, real-time, transactional.
   * OLAP → Analytical, historical, decision-support.
3. **ETL Steps:** Extraction → Transformation → Loading.
4. **Metadata:** Descriptive information about data; helps track sources, transformations, and definitions.
5. **Warehouse vs Mart:** Warehouse is enterprise-wide; mart is department-specific.
6. **Star vs Snowflake:** Star = denormalized; Snowflake = normalized.
7. **Data Cube:** Multi-dimensional data view (e.g., Sales by Product, Region, Time).
8. **Characteristics:** Subject-oriented, Integrated, Time-variant, Non-volatile.
9. **Architecture:** Source → ETL → Data Warehouse → OLAP/BI Tools.
10. **Cleaning vs Transformation:** Cleaning = correcting errors; Transformation = format conversion.
