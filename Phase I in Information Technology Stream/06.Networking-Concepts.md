## **1. Networking Concepts**

Networking is the practice of connecting computers and devices to share resources (files, internet, printers) and communicate efficiently.

**Key terms:**

* **Node:** Any device on the network (computer, printer, router).
* **Host:** A networked device with an IP address.
* **Link:** Communication path (wired or wireless).
* **Bandwidth:** Maximum data transfer rate.
* **Latency:** Time taken for data to travel from source to destination.

**Types of networks:**

* **LAN (Local Area Network):** Small area like office/home.
* **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Large geographic area (internet).
* **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** City-wide network.
* **PAN (Personal Area Network):** Close-range (Bluetooth, USB).

## **2. ISO/OSI Model**

The **OSI model** is a conceptual framework to understand network interactions. It has **7 layers**:

| Layer | Name         | Function                                  | Example                 |
| ----- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 7     | Application  | Provides network services to apps         | HTTP, FTP               |
| 6     | Presentation | Data translation, encryption, compression | JPEG, SSL               |
| 5     | Session      | Session management, synchronization       | NetBIOS, RPC            |
| 4     | Transport    | End-to-end delivery, error checking       | TCP, UDP                |
| 3     | Network      | Logical addressing, routing               | IP, ICMP                |
| 2     | Data Link    | Physical addressing, error detection      | Ethernet, MAC addresses |
| 1     | Physical     | Transmission of raw bits                  | Cables, hubs            |

**Tip for remembering:** *All People Seem To Need Data Processing* (Application → Physical).

## **3. LAN Technologies**

### **a) Ethernet**

* Most widely used LAN technology.
* Standard: **IEEE 802.3**
* Uses **CSMA/CD** (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection).
* Speeds: 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps.
* Media: Twisted pair, fiber optic, coaxial.

### **b) Token Ring**

* Standard: **IEEE 802.5**
* Uses **token-passing** to avoid collisions.
* Devices form a logical **ring**.
* Data is transmitted only if a device has the token.
* Speed: 4 Mbps or 16 Mbps.

**Key difference:** Ethernet is collision-based; Token Ring is token-based.

## **4. TCP / UDP**

| Feature        | TCP                                | UDP                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Type           | Connection-oriented                | Connectionless               |
| Reliability    | Reliable, acknowledgments          | Unreliable                   |
| Error checking | Yes                                | Minimal                      |
| Speed          | Slower                             | Faster                       |
| Use cases      | Web browsing, email, file transfer | Streaming, VoIP, DNS queries |

* **TCP** ensures **data delivery in order**, splitting data into packets.
* **UDP** just sends packets without checking delivery.

---

## **5. IP (Internet Protocol)**

* IP is responsible for **addressing and routing** data.
* **IPv4:** 32-bit, e.g., 192.168.1.1
* **IPv6:** 128-bit, e.g., 2001:0db8::1
* **Subnetting:** Divides network into smaller parts.
* **CIDR notation:** e.g., 192.168.1.0/24

**Key concepts:**

* IP header, TTL (Time to Live)
* Packet forwarding
* ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) maps IP → MAC

## **6. Basic Concepts of Switches, Routers, and Gateways**

| Device  | Layer                          | Function                                                          |
| ------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Switch  | Layer 2 (Data Link)            | Forwards frames within LAN using MAC addresses                    |
| Router  | Layer 3 (Network)              | Routes packets between networks using IP addresses                |
| Gateway | Layer 4+ (Application/Network) | Connects different protocol networks; often includes NAT/firewall |

* Switches reduce collisions in LAN.
* Routers connect LANs to the internet.
* Gateways can translate between different network protocols.

## **7. Application Layer Protocols**

### **DNS (Domain Name System)**

* Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
* Uses **UDP port 53** for queries.
* Hierarchical: Root → TLD → Authoritative → Caching.

### **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**

* Sends emails between servers.
* Uses **TCP port 25**.
* Works with POP/IMAP for retrieving emails.

### **POP (Post Office Protocol)**

* Retrieves emails from server to local device.
* Uses **TCP port 110** (POP3).
* Emails usually downloaded and removed from server.

### **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**

* Transfers files between client and server.
* Uses **TCP ports 20 (data), 21 (control)**.
* Modes: Active / Passive.

### **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**

* Transfers web pages over the internet.
* Uses **TCP port 80**, HTTPS uses **TCP 443**.
* Stateless protocol; each request is independent.

## **8. Firewalls**

* A firewall is a **security device/software** that monitors and controls incoming/outgoing network traffic based on rules.
* Types:

  * **Packet-filtering firewall:** Checks IP addresses, ports.
  * **Stateful firewall:** Tracks connection states.
  * **Proxy firewall:** Intermediates requests, hides client IP.
  * **Next-gen firewall:** Includes intrusion prevention, deep packet inspection.

**Key functions:**

* Block unauthorized access.
* Monitor traffic for malicious activity.
* Implement network segmentation.
