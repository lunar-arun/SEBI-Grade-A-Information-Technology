# **1. Information & Cyber Security Concepts**

Cybersecurity is the practice of **protecting computer systems, networks, and data** from unauthorized access, theft, damage, or disruption.

**Key aspects:**

* **Information Security (InfoSec):** Protects data confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad).
* **Cybersecurity:** Broader, includes defending against **cyber attacks, malware, social engineering, and network threats**.
* **Threat:** Potential cause of unwanted incident (e.g., hacker, malware).
* **Vulnerability:** Weakness in a system that can be exploited.
* **Risk:** Likelihood of threat exploiting vulnerability and its impact.
* **Mitigation:** Measures taken to reduce risk (firewalls, patches, encryption).

# **2. Cyber Attacks**

Cyber attacks are actions taken by attackers to **compromise, disrupt, or steal information**.

**Types of cyber attacks:**

| Type                             | Description                                  | Example                               |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |

| **Phishing**                     | Deceptive emails to steal info               | Email claiming “reset password”       |
| **Ransomware**                   | Encrypts files, demands ransom               | WannaCry, NotPetya                    |
| **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)** | Overloads servers, makes service unavailable | SYN flood attack                      |
| **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**     | Intercepts communication                     | Sniffing, eavesdropping               |
| **SQL Injection**                | Exploit web apps to access DB                | Entering ` ‘ OR 1=1 --` in login form |
| **Zero-Day Attack**              | Exploit unknown vulnerability                | Exploiting a new bug before patch     |

# **3. Software Development Security**

Security in software development is called **Secure SDLC** (Software Development Life Cycle).

**Principles:**

* **Secure by design:** Include security from the start.
* **Least privilege:** Users/processes have only necessary permissions.
* **Input validation:** Prevent SQL injection, XSS attacks.
* **Code review & testing:** Identify vulnerabilities early.
* **Patch management:** Update libraries and dependencies.

**Common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10):**

1. Injection
2. Broken Authentication
3. Sensitive Data Exposure
4. XML External Entities (XXE)
5. Broken Access Control
6. Security Misconfiguration
7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
8. Insecure Deserialization
9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

# **4. Network Security**

Network security protects **data in transit** and **network infrastructure**.

**Techniques & devices:**

* **Firewalls:** Control traffic based on rules.
* **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Detects suspicious activity.
* **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):** Blocks malicious activity.
* **VPNs:** Encrypt traffic over public networks.
* **Network segmentation:** Isolates sensitive parts of the network.

**Common attacks on networks:**

* DDoS
* ARP spoofing
* Packet sniffing
* Man-in-the-middle

---

# **5. Authentication**

Authentication ensures that a user or system is **genuine**.

**Types:**

* **Something you know:** Password, PIN
* **Something you have:** Token, smart card
* **Something you are:** Biometrics (fingerprint, iris scan)
* **Multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Combines two or more methods

**Authentication protocols:**

* **Kerberos** – Ticket-based secure authentication
* **OAuth / OpenID Connect** – Web & API authentication
* **RADIUS / TACACS+** – Network device authentication

---

# **6. CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)**

**Confidentiality:** Ensures information is accessed only by authorized parties.

* Techniques: Encryption (AES, RSA), access control, data classification

**Integrity:** Ensures data is **accurate and unaltered**.

* Techniques: Hashing (SHA-256), digital signatures, checksums

**Availability:** Ensures information and systems are **accessible when needed**.

* Techniques: Redundancy, backups, disaster recovery, DDoS mitigation

# **7. Network Audit**

Network audit evaluates a network’s **security, performance, and compliance**.

**Steps:**

1. **Asset identification:** Identify devices, servers, switches, routers
2. **Policy review:** Check firewall rules, ACLs, authentication policies
3. **Vulnerability scanning:** Identify weak points using tools like Nessus
4. **Traffic analysis:** Check bandwidth, latency, anomalies
5. **Penetration testing:** Simulate attacks to find weaknesses

**Purpose:**

* Ensure network security
* Detect misconfigurations or intrusions
* Regulatory compliance (e.g., SEBI, RBI IT guidelines)

---

# **8. Systems Audit**

A systems audit evaluates **IT systems and processes** for **security, efficiency, and compliance**.

**Focus areas:**

* Operating systems and applications
* Access controls and user permissions
* Backup and recovery procedures
* Logging and monitoring mechanisms

**Types:**

* **Internal audit:** Conducted by organization’s own team
* **External audit:** Conducted by certified auditors for compliance

**Common audit standards/frameworks:**

* **ISO 27001:** Information security management
* **COBIT:** IT governance and control
* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:** Risk management & controls

**Benefits:**

* Detects security gaps
* Prevents financial loss & data breaches
* Helps in compliance with SEBI, RBI, GDPR
