# 🐚 **Shell Programming – Complete Notes**

---

## 🧩 **1. Introduction to Shell Programming**

### What is a Shell?

* **Shell** is a **command-line interpreter** that provides a user interface to access the services of the operating system.
* It acts as a **bridge between the user and the kernel**.
* Common Linux shells:

  * **sh** (Bourne shell)
  * **bash** (Bourne Again Shell – most widely used) (Most popular on Linux   )
  * **csh** (C Shell)
  * **ksh** (Korn shell)
  * **zsh** (Z Shell)

### Why Shell Programming?

* To **automate repetitive tasks**.
* To perform **system administration** efficiently.
* To **combine multiple UNIX commands** in a single file and execute them together.

---

## 🧾 **2. Shell Scripting Basics**

### What is a Shell Script?

* A **text file containing a sequence of shell commands**.
* Executed by the shell **line by line**.
* File extension: `.sh`

#### Example of a simple shell script (`hello.sh`):

```sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

### Steps to Create and Run a Shell Script

1. Create a new file:

   ```bash
   nano myscript.sh
   ```
2. Add the **shebang line** at the top:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   ```

* **Note:**

* ### **Structure of a Shell Script**

* ### **Shebang (#!)**

* The first line tells the system which interpreter to use.

* Examples:

* `#!/bin/bash` → use Bash
* `#!/bin/sh` → use default shell

* ### **Comments**

* Use `#` to add comments.

```sh
# This is a comment
```

   (This line tells the system which shell to use to execute the script.)
   
3. Add commands:

   ```bash
   echo "Hello, SEBI Aspirant!"
   ```
4. Make the file executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x myscript.sh
   ```
5. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./myscript.sh
   ```

## 🧮 **3. Shell Variables**

### Types of Variables

| Type                       | Description                 | Example                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **User-defined Variables** | Created by the user         | `name="Ravi"`            |
| **System Variables**       | Defined by the system/shell | `$HOME`, `$USER`, `$PWD` |

### Syntax

```bash
varname=value
echo $varname
```

### Rules:

* No spaces before or after `=`.
* Variable names are **case-sensitive**.
* To access a variable, use the `$` symbol.

### Examples

```bash
name="SEBI"
echo "Welcome to $name Grade A IT Prep"
```

---

## 💬 **4. Shell Script Arguments**

Arguments are **values passed to the script** when it is executed.

### Syntax:

```bash
./scriptname arg1 arg2 arg3
```

### Inside the Script:

| Symbol | Meaning             |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| `$0`   | Script name         |
| `$1`   | First argument      |
| `$2`   | Second argument     |
| `$@`   | All arguments       |
| `$#`   | Number of arguments |

### Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script Name: $0"
echo "First Argument: $1"
echo "Second Argument: $2"
echo "Total Arguments: $#"
```

---

## 🔀 **5. Conditional Statements (If Statement)**

### Syntax:

```bash
if [ condition ]
then
   commands
elif [ condition ]
then
   commands
else
   commands
fi
```

### Common Operators:

| Type      | Operators                                | Example              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Numeric   | `-eq`, `-ne`, `-gt`, `-lt`, `-ge`, `-le` | `[ $a -gt $b ]`      |
| String    | `=`, `!=`, `-z`, `-n`                    | `[ "$str" = "abc" ]` |
| File Test | `-e`, `-f`, `-d`, `-r`, `-w`, `-x`       | `[ -f file.txt ]`    |

### Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
num=10
if [ $num -gt 5 ]
then
   echo "Number is greater than 5"
else
   echo "Number is less or equal to 5"
fi
```

---

## 🔁 **6. Loops in Shell**

### a) **For Loop**

```bash
for var in 1 2 3 4 5
do
  echo "Value: $var"
done
```

**Range Loop Example:**

```bash
for i in {1..5}
do
  echo "Iteration $i"
done
```

### b) **While Loop**

```bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]
do
  echo "Count is $count"
  count=$((count + 1))
done
```

### c) **Until Loop**

```bash
count=1
until [ $count -gt 5 ]
do
  echo "Count is $count"
  count=$((count + 1))
done
```

---

## 🔙 **7. Return / Exit Status**

Every command in UNIX returns an **exit status**:

* `0` → success
* Non-zero → failure

You can use `$?` to check the exit status of the last command.

### Example:

```bash
mkdir testdir
if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
  echo "Directory created successfully."
else
  echo "Failed to create directory."
fi
```

### Using `exit` Command

```bash
exit 0   # normal exit
exit 1   # indicates an error
```

## ⚙️ **8. Basic UNIX Commands (Commonly Used in Shell Scripts)**

| Command         | Description                      | Example                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
