# 📘 **SQL Notes for SEBI Grade A – IT Stream**

---

## 🔹 1. SQL Overview

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is used to manage and manipulate data in a **relational database**.
It includes:

* **DDL (Data Definition Language)** – defines structure (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`)
* **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** – manipulates data (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)
* **DCL (Data Control Language)** – controls access (`GRANT`, `REVOKE`)
* **TCL (Transaction Control Language)** – manages transactions (`COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`)

---

## 🔹 2. SELECT Statement

**Purpose:** Retrieve data from one or more tables.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column [ASC|DESC];
```

**Examples:**

```sql
-- Select all columns
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Select specific columns with condition
SELECT emp_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

---

## 🔹 3. VIEW

**Definition:** A **view** is a **virtual table** based on a query. It doesn’t store data physically.

**Syntax:**

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE VIEW high_salary_emps AS
SELECT emp_name, department
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 100000;
```

**Benefits:**

* Simplifies complex queries
* Provides data security (restricts column access)
* Logical data independence

**To see view data:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM high_salary_emps;
```

**To remove view:**

```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

---

## 🔹 4. TRUNCATE

**Purpose:** Removes all rows from a table **but keeps the structure**.

**Syntax:**

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```

**Key Points:**

* DDL command (cannot be rolled back)
* Faster than `DELETE` (no WHERE clause, no logging of individual rows)

---

## 🔹 5. DELETE

**Purpose:** Removes specific rows from a table.

**Syntax:**

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Example:**

```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE department = 'HR';
```

**Key Points:**

* DML command (can be rolled back)
* Can delete specific rows using `WHERE`
* Use carefully without WHERE — deletes all rows

---

## 🔹 6. UPDATE

**Purpose:** Modify existing records.

**Syntax:**

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE condition;
```

**Example:**

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.10
WHERE department = 'Finance';
```

**Key Points:**

* Always use WHERE to avoid updating all rows unintentionally.

---

## 🔹 7. ALTER

**Purpose:** Modify table structure (add, delete, modify columns).

**Syntax & Examples:**

```sql
-- Add column
ALTER TABLE employees ADD age INT;

-- Modify column
ALTER TABLE employees MODIFY salary DECIMAL(10,2);

-- Drop column
ALTER TABLE employees DROP COLUMN age;

-- Rename column
ALTER TABLE employees RENAME COLUMN emp_name TO employee_name;
```

---

## 🔹 8. INNER JOIN

**Purpose:** Returns rows that have **matching values** in both tables.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT a.column, b.column
FROM table1 a
INNER JOIN table2 b
ON a.common_column = b.common_column;
```

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT e.emp_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d
ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

**Result:** Only employees with a valid department entry.

---

## 🔹 9. Types of OUTER JOINS

### (a) LEFT OUTER JOIN

Returns **all rows from the left table** and **matching rows from the right table**.

```sql
SELECT e.emp_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d
ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

Unmatched rows in right table → NULL values.

---

### (b) RIGHT OUTER JOIN

Returns **all rows from the right table**, and **matching rows from the left**.

```sql
SELECT e.emp_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d
ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

---

### (c) FULL OUTER JOIN

Returns **all rows when there is a match in either table**.

```sql
SELECT e.emp_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
FULL OUTER JOIN departments d
ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
```

Unmatched rows in either table → NULL values.

---

## 🔹 10. Aggregate Functions

**Definition:** Perform calculations on a set of rows and return a single value.

| Function  | Description   | Example                              |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `COUNT()` | Counts rows   | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;`    |
| `SUM()`   | Adds values   | `SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;` |
| `AVG()`   | Average value | `SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;` |
| `MIN()`   | Minimum value | `SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees;` |
| `MAX()`   | Maximum value | `SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;` |

**Grouping Example:**

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 80000;
```

---

## 🔹 11. UNION

**Purpose:** Combine results of two SELECT queries.
**Removes duplicates by default.**

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column1 FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1 FROM table2;
```

**Rules:**

* Both queries must have same number of columns.
* Data types must be compatible.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT emp_name FROM employees_2024
UNION
SELECT emp_name FROM employees_2025;
```

---

## 🔹 12. INTERSECTION

**Purpose:** Returns **common rows** between two result sets.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT column FROM table2;
```

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT emp_id FROM project_A
INTERSECT
SELECT emp_id FROM project_B;
```

**Result:** Employees working in both projects.

---

## 🔹 13. EXCEPT (or MINUS)

**Purpose:** Returns rows from the **first query that are not present in the second**.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column FROM table1
EXCEPT
SELECT column FROM table2;
```

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT emp_id FROM all_employees
EXCEPT
SELECT emp_id FROM resigned_employees;
```

**Result:** Active employees.

*(In Oracle, use `MINUS` instead of `EXCEPT`.)*

---

## 🔹 14. IN and EXISTS Clauses

### (a) IN

Checks if a value matches any value in a list or subquery.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE dept_id IN (10, 20, 30);
```

**With subquery:**

```sql
SELECT emp_name
FROM employees
WHERE dept_id IN (SELECT dept_id FROM departments WHERE location = 'Delhi');
```

---

### (b) EXISTS

Checks if a **subquery returns any rows** (boolean check).

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT emp_name
FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM departments d
    WHERE e.dept_id = d.dept_id
    AND d.location = 'Delhi'
);
```

**Difference between IN and EXISTS:**

| Feature     | IN                          | EXISTS                      |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Compares    | Values                      | Existence of rows           |
| Performance | Better for small subqueries | Better for large subqueries |
| Type        | Value-based                 | Boolean-based               |

## 🔹 Quick Comparison Summary

| Command    | Type | Rollback Possible | Affects Structure | Deletes Data |
| ---------- | ---- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| `DELETE`   | DML  | ✅ Yes             | ❌ No              | ✅ Yes        |
| `TRUNCATE` | DDL  | ❌ No              | ❌ No              | ✅ Yes (all)  |
| `ALTER`    | DDL  | ❌ No              | ✅ Yes             | ❌ No         |
